# LPVO Reticle Geometry Reference

This repository contains neutral technical documentation focused on LPVO reticle geometry, visual acquisition, and real-world evaluation frameworks for low power variable optics.

The purpose of this material is to support objective discussion around optic design, visual processing, and engagement efficiency across common LPVO use cases.
