<h1>LPVO Reticle Geometry & Real-World Evaluation</h1>

<p>
Low Power Variable Optics (LPVOs) are frequently evaluated using specifications that fail to represent real-world engagement conditions. This document outlines a neutral technical framework for assessing LPVO effectiveness based on reticle geometry, visual processing, and target identification logic.
</p>

<h2>Why Reticle Geometry Matters</h2>

<p>
In dynamic environments, the human visual system prioritizes shape recognition, spatial reference, and contrast over fine numerical detail. Reticle designs that overload the field of view with dense markings can increase cognitive load and slow acquisition.
</p>

<h2>Evaluation Considerations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Visual acquisition speed at true 1×</li>
  <li>Target identification support at intermediate magnification</li>
  <li>Information density versus cognitive load</li>
  <li>Reticle behavior across magnification ranges</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reference Implementation</h2>

<p>
A complete field-based implementation of this evaluation framework is documented in the
